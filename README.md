# Automated-Timetable-System (ATTS)
ATTS is an automated technology that creates schedules faster than the manual way. Certain restrictions must be followed in order to build a timeline and arrive at an ideal or nearly perfect solution. Soft and hard constraints can be used to categorize these circumstances. Hard constraints are restrictions that cannot be broken in order to reach the best outcome. For instance, a schedule that calls for two lectures to be held simultaneously in the same location (a class-clash limitation). 

A web-based system called ATTS was created with the goal of resolving the issue of the amount of time and effort required to distribute available resources (lecturers, classrooms, etc.). Web technologies, such as; HTML, CSS, JS, PHP and MYSQL were used in the implementation of this project.

### ALGORITHM USED

FIREFLY ALGORITHM: The firefly algorithm was inspired by the flashing behavior of fireflies. Problems involving optimization can be solved using this approach. A population of fireflies is first established, and the less desirable fireflies are transferred to the more desirable fireflies. The "Law of Intensity of Light" (I = k / r2) serves as another source of inspiration for this approach.

### THE SYSTEM

PHP was used to create a simple notification system for the front-end. This was added to the system to help the timetable administrator navigate it and to inform them when they are carrying out tasks correctly or incorrectly. When a button is pressed, the schedule is created. The system gives the administrator access to five modules: the department, semester, courses, lecturers, and timetable module. The admin will be able to add, read, update, and remove the data they have supplied because each module was developed using the CRUD process. Web formsÂ on the system will be used to collect the admin's data. A database will be used to store this data. The created schedule is dependent upon the information made accessible by the timetable admin

The system's CRUD activities are shown in images. The administrator may Create, Read, Update, and Delete data in the system.

# THE RESULTING TIMETABLE(S)

The system provides a form that asks for information about the department, semester, and level for which the resultant schedules are to be created. With just a click of a button, the schedules are generated. As this website is refreshed, the schedules are updated.
